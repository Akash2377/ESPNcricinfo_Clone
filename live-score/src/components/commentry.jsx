        <Div>Fazalhaq Farooqi to Kohli, no run, Kohli's rollicking knock of <b>122*(61)</b> powers India to <b>212/2!</b> A dot ball to end the innings as he runs down the wicket and gets beaten due to the pace and bounce on this short one. His team-mates walk to the sidelines to congratulate and give him a hug. He is all smiles and looks relieved as he has finally managed to break that jinx of the 71st international century</Div>
        <Div>Fazalhaq Farooqi to Pant, 1 run, yorker length ball by Fazalhaq Farooqi and Pant has squeezed it to long-on for a single</Div>
        <Div>Fazalhaq Farooqi to Kohli, 1 run, touch fuller on middle and leg, Kohli flicks this over square leg for a single. The timing was good, but not enough power behind the shot</Div>
        <Div>Fazalhaq Farooqi to Kohli, <b>FOUR, 6, 6, 4!</b> Makes room and creams this half-volley through cover for four runs. No one on the field moved, and that rockets away to the fence at the rate of knots</Div>
        <Div>Fazalhaq Farooqi to Kohli, <b>SIX</b>, pulled away! Fraction short around middle and leg, Kohli rocks back and pulls it over deep mid-wicket as he picks the bones out of this slower one</Div>
        <Div>Fazalhaq Farooqi to Kohli, <b>SIX</b>, thumped! A fraction short delivery around off, Kohli shimmies down the wicket and tonks it over long-off for half-a-dozen. Dealing in sixes is Kohli!</Div>
